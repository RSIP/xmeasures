purpose "Extrinsic measures evaluation: Omega Index (a fuzzy version of the\
 Adjusted Rand Index, identical to the Fuzzy Rand Index) and [mean] F1-score\
 (prob, harm and avg) for the overlapping multi-resolution clusterings,\

 Unequal node base is allowed in the evaluating clusterings and optionally can\
 be synchronized removing nodes from the clusters missed in one of the clusterings (collections)."

description "Extrinsic measures are evaluated, i.e. two input clusterings\
 (collections of clusters) are compared to each other. Optionally, a labeling\
 of the evaluating clusters with the specified ground-truth clusters is performed.
NOTE:
  - Multiple evaluating measures can be specified.
  - Each cluster should contain unique members, which is ensured only if the\
 'unique' option is specified.
  - All clusters should be unique to not affect Omega Index evaluation, which\
  can be ensured by the [resmerge](https://github.com/eXascaleInfolab/resmerge) utility.
  - Non-corrected unequal node base in the clusterings is allowed, it penalizes the match.\
Use [OvpNMI](https://github.com/eXascaleInfolab/OvpNMI) or\
 [GenConvNMI](https://github.com/eXascaleInfolab/GenConvNMI) for NMI evaluation\
 in the arbitrary collections (still each cluster should contain unique members).

Evaluating measures are:
  - OI  - Omega Index (a fuzzy version of the Adjusted Rand Index, identical to\
  the Fuzzy Rand Index), which yields the same value as Adjusted Rand Index when\
  applied to the non-overlapping clusterings.
  - [M]F1  - various [mean] F1 measures of the Greatest (Max) Match including\
  the Average F1-Score (suggested by J. Leskovec) with the optional weighting.
NOTE: There are 3 matching policies available for each kind of F1. The most\
  representative evaluation is performed by the F1p with combined matching\
  policy (considers both micro and macro weighting).
  - NMI  - Normalized Mutual Information, normalized by either max or also sqrt,\
 avg and min information content denominators.
ATTENTION: This is a standard NMI, which should be used ONLY for the HARD\
 partitioning evaluation (non-overlapping clustering on a single resolution).\
  It penalizes overlapping and multi-resolution structures.
